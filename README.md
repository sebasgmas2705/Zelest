# Zelest
First SwiftUI project


Hi, my name is Sebastian Gelabert Mas and I just started learning swiftUI three weeks ago... I decided to code a quick and "useful" app in order to make the learning experience easier and it's been a way to force myself to stop watching tutorials and start coding.
I know it is not the best... but hope this helps anyone wanting to learn swiftUI. Have fun! ðŸ’»

Here are some screenshots from the app:
